        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          A tufted titmouse is a small bird found in North America, a species falling in the tit and
          Chickadee family.
          <br />
          The genus name "Baeolophus" in simple terms means a 'small crested' and is formed of
          fusion of two Ancient Greek words. The term bicolor means two-colored.
        </p>
        <h3>Descriptives:</h3>
        <p>Measurements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Length: 14-16 cm</li>
          <li>Wingspan: 20-26 cm</li>
          <li>Weight: 17-26 grams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These birds have a white front, and grey upper body with rust coloured flanks. They also
          have a tufted, grey crest on their heads, and a black forehead. The black forehead is
          notably reduced in youngsters, making them easily mistaken for oak titmice. In general,
          males are bigger than females.
        </p>
        <h3>Chirp:</h3>
        <p>
          These birds usually sing something similar to a whistled <i>peter-peter-peter</i>,
          although it can vary and hence has 20 different versions of it.
        </p>
        <h3>Habitats and Distribution:</h3>
        <p>
          Its natural habitat includes shrublands, gardens, parks, and mixed and deciduous
          woodlands. The tufted titmouse is a non-migratory bird that used to be found only in the
          Ohio and Mississippi River basins. However, due to factors like bird feeders, it has
          spread its range across the United States and into Ontario and Quebec in Canada. The
          species' territory has been extending farther north over the second part of the 20th
          century and into the 21st.

        <h3>Food:</h3>
        <p>
          Insects such as caterpillars, beetles, ants, wasps, stink bugs, treehoppers, spiders, and
          snails are the main summertime food of tufted titmice. Acorns and beech nuts are some of
          the seeds, nuts, and berries that Tufted Titmice feed on. Tufted Titmice studies revealed
          that they always pick the biggest seeds available when foraging.

        <h3>Nesting:</h3>
        <p>
          Although Tufted Titmice can nest in cavities, they are unable to dig them out on their
          own. They make advantage of the natural openings and abandoned nest cavities left behind
          by a variety of woodpecker species, even big ones like the Pileated Woodpecker and
          Northern Flicker. Tufted Titmice also build their nests in metal pipes, fenceposts, and
          nest boxes made of man-made materials.
        </p>

        <h3>How does a nest of these Birds look like?</h3>
        <p>
          Titmice use damp leaves, moss and grasses, and strips of bark to build cup-shaped nests
          inside the nest hole. They sometimes remove hairs straight from living animals to line
          this cup, lining it with soft materials like hair, fur, wool, and cotton. Raccoon,
          opossum, dog, fox squirrel, red squirrel, rabbit, horse, cow, cat, mouse, woodchuck, and
          even human hair have been found in titmouse nests by naturalists who have examined old
          nests. It usually takes 6 to 11 days to build a nest.

        <h2>SOME FACTS ABOUT TUFTED TITMICE</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The oldest Tufted Titmouse in the wild ever found lived at least 13 years, 3 months old.
            In Virginia, it was found in 1962, and in the same state, it was discovered in 1974.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            At times, the Black-crested Titmouse of Texas and Mexico has been mistaken for a Tufted
            Titmouse. When the two species meet, hybridization occurs, but the zone is small and
            stable over time. They exhibit genetic variations as well as a minor difference in call
            quality.

        </ul>
        <h3>Behaviour:</h3>
        <p>
          Tufted Titmice look for food by flying from branch to branch of the forest canopy,
          frequently in the company of other birds like nuthatches, chickadees, kinglets, and
          woodpeckers. Titmice normally grasp the seed with their feet and crack it open with their
          beaks when they encounter large seeds, like the sunflower seeds they collect from bird
          feeders. They often store these shelled seeds in bark cracks during the fall and winter.
          These acrobatic foragers frequently hang sideways or upside down while they inspect cones,
          branch undersides, and leaf clusters. They may descend completely to the ground to walk
          around in hunt of scattered seeds or insects.
        </p>
        <h3>Conservation and Population Numbers:</h3>
        <p>
          According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, Tufted Titmice numbers have grown
          between 1966 and 2019 which makes them common. According to Partners in Flight, there are
          12 million mating birds worldwide, and the species receives a Continental Concern Score of
          7, which is the lowest possible score. Over the past 50 years, their range has been moving
          north. The rising temperatures, farmlands turning back into woods, and the rising
          popularity of home bird feeders are a few potential causes of range extension.
